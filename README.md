# NUI Mocks
### Purpose of the repo
* This repo is intended to be a basic comparison of the different UI 
frameworks available and figure which one will suit my use-case the most.

### What are we comparing?
We will be comparing the following UI frameworks:
* Bootstrap (~3.3.7)
* Semantic-UI (~2.2)
* Foundation (~6)
* More to come...

### What features are we comparing?
We will be comparing the following basic UI features:
* Tabs
* Nav bars (horizontal and vertical)
* Divisions
* Fluid layouts
  * Grids - Cols and Rows
  * Ease of setting/modifying gutters, margins, line grids, etc.
* RWD at various resolutions
* Icon set
* Extra markup - semanticity
* Drop n play support
* Amount of customization allowed, and required
* Rigidity of required markup
* Does JS play well with
  * jQuery
  * React
* Future upgrades and support

### Does this serve a purpose other than testing?
I intend for this repo to serve as a reasonable resource and refresher
for an experienced web dev getting back into the game. To serve that 
purpose, I will try my best to write this in a way where the code is 
readable and is documented sufficiently. 

### FAQ's
* Why these frameworks?
I did a quick Google search for the latest and greatest UI frameworks and 
came across these. If you know of better ones, please do let me know.

* What are you doing this for?
I need to select a good framework for something I am working on. I have been
out of touch with CSS and JS frameworks for a while now and have no idea which
one will suit my need. Googling only confuses me, so thought I might as well
test it out myself.
Hopefully, I can decide on the one that suits my needs and continue with 
that for a while.

* Why not just choose one and start?
I totally would, if this were a personal project, but sadly it is not, and I
need to help out a team of people with this.

* Why did you not include Bootstrap 4, Foundation 72, ZORG INVASION 3333?!?
At the time of starting this side project, these are the most recent stable
versions available. Note `stable`. This is important, as the project I am 
building is not experimental but a stable one.

* Why just these features? Why can't you compare more?
Please note that this is something I am doing in my free time. I neither 
get paid for this, nor am I doing this for myself. I am helping out in the 
little spare time I get. If you think I missed a key feature comparison,
please create an issue (good) or PR (preferred) with the changes. And I 
promise I will work with you to completion.
